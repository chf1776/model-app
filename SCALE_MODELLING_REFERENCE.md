## The Hobby at a Glance

Scale modelling is the craft of assembling miniature representations of real-world objects (tanks, aircraft, ships, cars, figures) from injection-moulded plastic kits, enhanced with aftermarket detail parts and finished with paint and weathering. The appeal spans historical accuracy, technical craftsmanship, and meditative focus.

**Subject categories:**
- **Military** — Tanks (AFVs), figures, artillery, trucks (dominant: 1:35 scale)
- **Aircraft** — WWII and modern jets (dominant: 1:72 and 1:48 scale)
- **Ships / Naval** — Warships, submarines (1:350, 1:700)
- **Cars & Motorcycles** — Race cars, historic vehicles (1:24, 1:25)
- **Sci-Fi / Fantasy** — Gundam, Warhammer, fictional vehicles
- **Figures** — Busts and dioramas (1:9, 1:10, 1:16)

**Common scales:**
| Scale | Ratio | Typical Subject |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1:24 | 1 mm = 24 mm | Cars |
| 1:32 | 1 mm = 32 mm | Aircraft, figures |
| 1:35 | 1 mm = 35 mm | Military vehicles (most popular) |
| 1:48 | 1 mm = 48 mm | Aircraft, military |
| 1:72 | 1 mm = 72 mm | Aircraft (most popular), vehicles |
| 1:144 | 1 mm = 144 mm | Small aircraft, figures |
| 1:350 | — | Ships |
| 1:700 | — | Small ships, fleets |

## Kit Anatomy

### The Base Kit
A plastic kit comes as a box containing:
- **Sprues (runners)** — Plastic frames with parts attached, labelled A, B, C... Each part has a number (e.g., A1, B12)
- **Instruction booklet** — Step-by-step assembly guide with exploded diagrams and part call-outs
- **Decal sheet** — Printed markings applied with water
- **Optional extras** — Turned metal barrels, pre-cut masks, PE sprues (in premium kits)

### Kit Numbering
Kits have a manufacturer-assigned **kit number** (e.g., Tamiya 35042, Hasegawa 09142) used universally to identify a specific moulding. This is distinct from the model name.

### Instruction Manuals
Instructions are typically A4/letter booklets, sometimes folding sheets. Key characteristics:
- Each **step** shows an exploded diagram with numbered parts to add
- Steps often include **colour call-outs** (e.g., "XF-69 NATO Black") referencing the manufacturer's paint range
- Some steps are independent **subassembly sequences** (e.g., "build the engine before closing the hull")
- A **parts map** at the front shows all sprues and part numbers
- Markings schemes at the back show decal placement options

---

## Build Workflow

A typical build follows this general sequence, though experienced builders adapt it heavily:

### 1. Preparation
- **Dry fit** all major parts without glue to check fit and plan sequence
- Identify which subassemblies need **pre-painting** before they become inaccessible
- Plan subassembly sequence to avoid painting yourself into a corner
- Clean parts off the sprue with **sprue cutters**, sand nubs smooth

### 2. Subassemblies
Most kits have parallel subassembly tracks that converge later:
- **Interior** (cockpit, fighting compartment) — built first, enclosed by outer hull/fuselage
- **Hull / Fuselage** — main body
- **Turret / Engine deck / Wings** — separate assemblies that join the main body
- **Running gear** — wheels, tracks, suspension (for tanks)
- **Armament** — guns, bombs, external loads

### 3. Primer
- Applied by brush or airbrush before any colour coats
- Reveals surface defects (seam lines, scratches) for correction
- Common: Mr. Surfacer (lacquer), Vallejo Primer (acrylic), Tamiya Fine Surface Primer

### 4. Base Coats
- One or more colour coats applied to the primed model
- Modulation techniques add depth (lighter highlights, darker shadows)

### 5. Decals
- Applied on a **gloss varnish** surface to prevent silvering (air trapped under decal)
- Softening agents (Micro Sol, Mr. Mark Softer) help decals conform to surface detail
- Sealed with another varnish after

### 6. Weathering
- Applied over a gloss or satin surface (enamels wipe off gloss more easily)
- Sealed with matte varnish at the end

### 7. Final Assembly
- Parts left off during painting (clear parts, fragile antennae, tracks) added last
- Tracks on tanks may be completed at this stage (link-and-length vs. single-piece)

## Adhesives

| Adhesive | Use | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| **Liquid cement (MEK)** | Plastic-to-plastic | Welds styrene chemically; capillary action draws it in; strong bond |
| **Tube cement** | Plastic-to-plastic | Gap-filling; slower; messier |
| **CA glue (super glue)** | Metal, PE, resin, rubber | Thin for wicking, medium for general, thick for gap-filling |
| **CA accelerator** | With CA glue | Instantly cures CA; can craze clear parts |
| **Epoxy (2-part)** | Heavy parts, metals | Strongest bond; slow cure |
| **White glue (PVA)** | Clear parts, photo film | Repositionable while wet; dries clear |
| **Micro Kristal Klear** | Clear parts, canopies | Won't craze plastic; excellent for small clear parts |

**Key rule**: Plastic cement does NOT bond to metal, resin, or PE. Use CA or epoxy for those.

## Paint Systems

### Types
| Type | Thinner | Pros | Cons |
|------|---------|------|------|
| **Acrylic** | Water / acrylic thinner | Low odour, fast dry, easy cleanup | Less durable than lacquer |
| **Enamel** | White spirit / odourless thinner | Self-levelling, great for washes/weathering | Slow dry, strong odour |
| **Lacquer** | Lacquer thinner (strong) | Hard finish, excellent primer | Strong fumes, needs ventilation |
| **Oil paint** | Odourless thinner | Excellent for blending, filters, fading | Very slow dry |

### Layering Order (safest to most dangerous)
1. Lacquer primer / base
2. Acrylic over lacquer ✓ (safe)
3. Enamel wash over acrylic with gloss varnish seal ✓ (safe)
4. Lacquer over acrylic ✗ (can lift acrylic — requires sealed gloss layer)

### Major Paint Brands
- **Tamiya** — Acrylic; excellent consistency; most widely cross-referenced
- **Vallejo** — Acrylic; huge range; bottle dropper; popular for airbrush
- **AK Interactive** — Acrylic + enamel; weathering-focused
- **Mig Ammo** — Enamel washes; weathering effects
- **Mr. Color (GSI Creos)** — Lacquer; Japanese standard; extremely durable
- **Humbrol** — Enamel; UK-traditional; many colour references in older kits

### Paint Stages in a Build
1. **Primer** — grey, black, or red oxide; reveals defects
2. **Pre-shading** — dark lines along panel edges before base coat
3. **Base coat** — main colour(s)
4. **Modulation / post-shading** — highlights and shadows added
5. **Gloss varnish** — seals base coat, prepares for decals and enamel washes
6. **Decals**
7. **Decal softener + second gloss varnish** — seals decals
8. **Enamel wash** — dark brown/black into recesses; wiped off high surfaces
9. **Chipping / streaking** — paint damage effects
10. **Pigments** — dust, mud, rust applied dry
11. **Matte varnish** — final seal; kills shine

## Photo Etched (PE) Parts

### What They Are
- Ultra-thin brass or steel sheets chemically etched to create highly detailed parts
- Replicate items too thin or delicate for injection moulding: grilles, railings, seatbelts, instrument panels
- Supplied on a **fret** (carrier sheet)

### Common PE Manufacturers
- **Eduard** (Czech) — largest range; also makes "BigEd" kits with PE included
- **Aber** (Poland) — highly detailed; tanks and accessories
- **Voyager** — tank accessories, very detailed
- **Part** (Poland) — aircraft and military

### Working with PE
**Tools needed:**
- **PE bending tool** ("Hold & Fold", Etchmate) — clamps the part at the fold line; a metal tool makes the bend
- **Fine tweezers** — for handling; curved tip preferred
- **Scalpel / hobby knife** — to remove parts from fret (score and bend, or cut directly)
- **Metal cutting mat** — protects surfaces

**Workflow:**
1. Clean fret with isopropyl alcohol (removes etching residue; improves glue adhesion)
2. Carefully remove parts with scalpel; never pull — they'll bend
3. Bend BEFORE painting (paint cracks on bent PE)
4. Apply CA glue with a toothpick or brush handle to one surface
5. Position with tweezers and hold until set (or use accelerator)
6. Prime with lacquer or special PE primer before painting
7. Anneal (heat with lighter briefly) to soften for curved bends — prevents cracking

**Common applications in military models:**
- Tank: pioneer tools stowage brackets, grilles, antenna mounts, mudguards
- Aircraft: cockpit instruments, seatbelts, bomb racks, panel detail
- Ship: railings (most common), ladders, radar arrays

## 3D Printed Parts

### Context
3D printing has become a significant aftermarket segment. Resin printing (MSLA/SLA) produces parts with resolution rivalling injection moulding at small scales.

### Types
- **Replacement parts** — replaces kit plastic with more detailed resin version
- **Conversions** — changes a variant (e.g., different turret configuration)
- **Accessories** — stowage, figures, weapons that aren't in the kit
- **Diorama elements** — bases, scenery, small-scale buildings

### Major Sources
- **Shapeways / Wargames Atlantic** — marketplace model; customer designs
- **Printed Loot, Model Monkey** — dedicated scale model 3D print shops
- **Thingiverse / Cults3D / MyMiniFactory** — free and paid STL files for home printing
- **RB Models, Master (brass)** — turned metal, distinct from 3D printing but similar niche

### Working with 3D Printed Resin Parts
- Requires **washing** in IPA and UV curing before use (if home-printed)
- May need **sanding** of print lines (less of an issue with high-end resin printers)
- Can be brittle; handle carefully
- Bonds with CA glue; does NOT accept plastic cement
- Some commercial parts (Shapeways) come in various materials (nylon/SLS is more flexible than resin)

### Home Printing for Scale Models
- **Resin printers** (Elegoo Saturn, Anycubic Photon) produce best detail
- Layer height matters: 0.05 mm or lower for fine detail
- Anti-aliasing and layer exposure settings critical for fine scale detail
- Parts often need supports removed and surfaces sanded/polished

## Modeller Workflow Patterns (Relevant to App Design)

### How Builders Actually Work
- **Chunked sessions**: Most builders work in 30–120 min sessions. A step might span multiple sessions if glue/paint is drying.
- **Parallel tracks**: Experienced builders work multiple subassemblies simultaneously (one drying while working on another)
- **Sequence planning**: "What can't I access after this step?" is a constant mental model
- **Paint staging**: Painting must happen at specific points — too early or too late creates problems
- **Drying time gates**: Glue and paint dictate pace. CA: 30–60s. Plastic cement: 24h for full strength. Primer: 30 min. Enamel: 24–48h.

### Common Build Management Pain Points
- Losing track of which subassemblies are at which stage
- Forgetting which parts need pre-painting before enclosure
- Missing a part that's now inaccessible
- Not remembering the colour mix used for a base coat
- No record of what aftermarket parts were used (relevant for contest judging)
- Photos taken out of order / not associated with steps

### What Builders Want to Document
- Progress photos at key moments (subassembly complete, before/after paint, weathering stages)
- Paint colours used (for touch-ups, future reference)
- What aftermarket was used and where
- Problem areas and how they were solved
- Reference photos used for accuracy
